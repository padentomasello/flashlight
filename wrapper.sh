# Be very wary of this explicit setting of CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES. Say you are
# running one task and asked for gres=gpu:1 then setting this variable will mean
# all your processes will want to run GPU 0 - disaster!! Setting this variable
# only makes sense in specific cases that I have described above where you are
# using gres=gpu:8 and I have spawned 8 tasks. So I need to divvy up the GPUs
# between the tasks. Think THRICE before you set this!!
